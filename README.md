# Malawi ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¼ Stock Exchange ðŸ“ˆ Scraper

A scraping tool for MSE Daily Reports, which are uploaded on [their site](https://mse.co.mw/index.php?route=market/market/report).  The tool basically goes through different daily reports (according tothe configuration) and downloads the PDFs before converting them to CSV and then eventually uploading to a Postgres Database.  What you do with the data is up to you! Just make sure you have a VPN when scraping.

We use [PDF Tables](https://pdftables.com/) to convert the PDFs to CSV, but you may use your own converter, at which point some of the logic in the `downloader` will need to be tweaked.
